# heart-rate
Heart rate monitor and recorder

I needed this because yesterday my heart rate shot to 200 (jolted off a nap in a train) and most apps failed to read it, including Google Fit. I could feel my heart pounding crazily but I couldn't actually check it.

This records the whole graph.
Will add a button to export the data as well. But its fine for now.

(Vibe coded with Gemini 3 Pro, 2nd or 3rd attempt, many prompts)
